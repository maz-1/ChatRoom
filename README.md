ChatRoom is a local MCP runtime that lets ChatGPT work with projects on your local device, run processes, send direct HTTP/HTTPS requests, or perform computer control. Its WebUI provides workspace browsing, Git repository and process management, computer control, ChatRoom Cloud management, and plugin-attributed operation logs.

## Install

Requires Node.js 24.15.0 or newer and Git.

```bash
npm install -g @chatroomcp/chatroom
chatroom init
chatroom serve
```

Windows users can also use [ChatRoom-Windows-Portable](https://github.com/dayearnew/ChatRoom-Windows-Portable) without configuring any dependencies themselves.

Default local endpoints:

```text
WebUI  http://127.0.0.1:8765/
MCP    http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
```

`chatroom init` creates the [configuration file](https://doc.chatroomcp.com/configuration) and uses `~/Projects` as the default allowed workspace root.

## Use with ChatGPT

ChatGPT connects to ChatRoom through its MCP endpoint. For remote access, either enable ChatRoom Cloud from the WebUI or expose ChatRoom through your own HTTPS ingress and configure the corresponding public URL.

Create a custom MCP app in ChatGPT Developer Mode, use the ChatRoom `/mcp` URL, and complete OAuth authorization with the `ownerToken` in the [configuration file](https://doc.chatroomcp.com/configuration).

See [Use ChatRoom with ChatGPT](https://doc.chatroomcp.com/chatgpt) for the current ChatGPT setup flow.

## ChatRoom Cloud

ChatRoom Cloud is built into ChatRoom and provides optional public access for Remote MCP and Remote WebUI. Open the **Cloud** page in the WebUI to purchase, restore, or manage access.
